# dotfiles
My personal config files for various machines and applications

For easy checking in and tracking of files, just symlink config files to here and check changes in git occasionally.  None of this is critical, but I don't want to turn saving my files into a hassle or I'll just end up never moving things to it.  The critical part is making sure that nothing private is included since the repo is public and I'd like to avoid embarassing myself with a security leak.

Actually, after attempting it, git on windows fails pretty hard with symlinks (huge surprise) so just occasionally copy key files or whatever.

**For Example:**

cp "C:\Users\click\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\Preferences.sublime-settings" Preferences.sublime-settings
